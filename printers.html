            <h1>Printers' Advice</h1>
            <p>As job printing became a career path in its own right, job printers published guides and shared samples of their work to learn from each other. They also put out their own specimen books, showing what typefaces they already owned. Some of these are distinctive enough that they can be connected back to typefounders' specimens. I encourage you to compare back and find some of these typefaces in the foundry specimen examples.</p>

                        <h3>The Printers' Practical Every-Day-Book</h3>
                        <p>Thomas Shaw Houghton</p>

                    <p>Hudson deems this the first printer's manual to devote substantial attention to job work, and my research concurs.<sup>1</sup> Its recommendations seem to reflect American design at the time as well, which is the other reason I've included it here even though it was not originally aimed at an American audience.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>[H]e who would cultivate his taste in display must observe nnd learn for himself what combinations, not only of the various sizes but also of the several descriptions of types, produce the neatest and happiest effect. His own judgement must be his guide.</p>

                        <p>[P]ropriety [of display] makes all the principal lines subservient to the object for which the job is printed, and applies as well to cards and circulars as to hand-bills and posters. But, perhaps, I may be better understood if I say that those lines only should be principals which will read and make known the object, independent of every other line. It is ability to do this readily, united with taste, that makes a good jobbing hand....</p>

                        <p>In hand-bills and posters, the large lines are made to read on with each other, to that the substance may be read at a glance. Any other particulars are only considered secondary lines, and are set small or large, according to their apparent import. Catch lines, which are merely used to connect one line with another, ore always set small, in capitals or small capitals. The following advertisement will perhaps illustrate the principle.</p>
                        <img class="loose" src="samples/houghton_example.png">
                        <p>In the above example, To be Sold — Phaeton — Mare — and Harness Complete, are principal lines, and would be perfectly understood without any other word; hence they are the largest, that they may be readily seen. By Private Treaty — About fourteen and a half hands high, &c. — are secondary-lines, or what would only be looked for if there were any desire to purchase. A beautiful four-wheeled — a fine well-bred — and — are catch-lines, because they are merely used to
                            connect the lines and to make them read smoothly. Apply, &c.— partakes more of the nature of a note, and hence the reason for being always cut off with a rule, and run on in smaller type. It is of little consequence what may be the size of the bill, whether for the hand or the wall, the <i>principle</i> which points out the leading and secondary lines is still the same. </p>

                    <p>R&A have many, many ornamented typefaces, for which they seem to have enormous enthusiasm.  That comes through in the clear layouts and decorative borders they use throughout.  I also highly recommend the introduction, which explains the organization of their printing business.</p> 
                    <blockquote><p>The Job Department. The specimens of type presented in the following pages of this book, numerous and diverse as they are, convey but an inadequate conception of the vast quantity and assortment daily in use in this department, and we are constantly increasing the variety and amount as new designs make their appearance from the founderies. The field is not limited by "diamond" and "pica," but only by the ingenuity of man. The internal arrangement of the room we are inspecting is similar to that of the Book Composition Room; but the labor performed in it requires quite a different order of talent, and to be a first-class Job Compositor is a high attainment in the art. Whether we have any in our employ who have gained that eminence is for others to decide; and to assist in that decision we present our plea, — this volume, with its specimens of type and of printing, and respectfully solicit for it an impartial examination.</p></blockquote>

                        <h3>Harpel's Typograph</h3>
                        <p>Oscar H. Harpel</p>
                        <p>1870</p>
                        <p>Cincinnati, OH</p>
                    </header>
                    <p>Using a similar format to Rand & Avery's, with a different border in a different color on every page, Harpel gives some advice for jobbing, then several hundred examples. The borders only seem to reinforce an almost celebratory attitude toward the possibilities of job design.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>In Job Letters we would recommend purchasing all the series of a really desirable face or none of them.” (8)</p>
                        <p>The principal beauty of all display composition proceeds from the judicious bringing together of harmonious type faces, rather than by means of overwrought, and frequently confusing, combinations, made up of things individually handsome, but rendered distasteful from there being too many similar ones placed together. Ornament often enhances the beauty of job composition; but, to be really effective, it must be relieved by contrast with what is simpler and plainer than
                            itself.</p>
                        <p>
                            The lines of display composition to be attractive must vary in their sizes and degrees of strength, exhibiting, as it were, the effects of light and shade. A long line should be placed between two shorter ones neither of the same length, and these again harmonized to others longer or shorter than themselves. Several lines of the same length (except in poster work between rules) following each other, do not look neat. Lines of large, heavy letters need to be relieved
                            with smaller light ones in the same manner.</p>
                        <p>
                            The crowding together of heavy-faced type — expressively called "loud" by printers — with but little space between lines to relieve them, in such descriptions of work as business cards; letter, note, and bill-heads; blanks- circulars (except small hand-bills); title-pages; and other kinds of printing — intended more particularly for private circulation and perusal, we consider in bad taste. It is true that patrons frequently demand such arrangements under the mistaken
                            idea that they are getting a more "telling" eftect. But we suspect this occurs, in many cases, more from the spirit of imitating others than from reflection about the matter. .... Handsome results may be had from type of a uniform style of face, provided the variety of sizes will allow them to relieve each other. (23)</p> 
                        <p>It is of importance after a piece of composition is done, to see that it is fairly "opened out," or with the lines so separated as to preserve a good balance relatively. It often occurs that otherwise really good work is marred by neglect or ignorance of this particular. We subjoin an illustration:</p>

                        <h3>The Young Job Printer</h3>
                        <p>Sidney M. Weatherly</p>
                        <p>1889</p>
                        <p>Chicago, IL</p>
                    </header>
                    <p>Weatherly's advice about typefaces is brief but in some cases highly specific. I did not run across anyone else advising against shaded letters, and I'm still curious what all contributed to his conclusion. He outright encourages buying "unique and novel faces", exactly the push that has kept type designers so busy over the previous few decades. After his advice, he gives five examples of good job work, which are all included below, and all reflect the way opinion is
                        slowly changing in favor of plainer, simpler faces. What he says about those examples suggests that he would agree with Houghton that while display can be taught, taste has to be developed individually.</p>


                    <blockquote>
                        <p>It is particularly important in the selection of type for a job office that care should be taken and taste exercised, first to choose such sizes and faces as are most likely to be brought into constant service by the character of the work to be performed, and, secondly, to choose such faces as are most durable.</p>
 <p>....</p> 
                        <p>Fancy letters should be eschewed by the printer of moderate means. Full series, from nonpareil to double pica, of Gothics, Antiques, Clarendons, Celtics, and the different series of Old Style should be secured first, and the second thought should be given to plain-faced, light and heavy, condensed, and extended letters. With such an assortment of type all kinds of work can be executed, from the ordinary bill-head or business-card to the neatest display job.
                            It has
                            come to be a recognized fact among good printers now-a-days that good effects in job work are best attained by the artistic arrangement of plain faces, hence their extreme usefulness.</p>
                        <p>The job printer, however, will find it necessary to have a few fancy fonts, the designs of which will be best suggested by the class of work contemplated, unique and novel faces, though, should be preferred.</p>
                        <p>Never buy extensively of shaded letters. They are by all odds the most unprofitable. The styles that wear the best, whether fancy or plain, are those which- have solid faces and no kerns. (13-14)</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <blockquote>Special attention is called to the following pages, which represent some of the most prominent and reliable dealers in printers' materials, etc., and are given as specimens of good composition, and they suggest to careful observers more in the way of artistic arrangement and selection of lines of type, borders, ornaments, etc., than can be shown in any other way. All, or any one of these pages, are embodiments of good taste and workmanship, and a careful study
                        of them will reveal much of the art of job composition, showing as they do that the best effects can be had from plain, clear-cut letters, with an occasional ornamental line, flourish, dash or fancy border added to make the appearance tasty and complete. (59)</blockquote>

                    <p>The consistent borders, layouts, specimen numbering, and titling in this book all hint at the move towards "cleaner" composition, as does the general lack of ornamented faces (though there are still plenty of display faces). There is a table of contents at the beginning that shows how relatively few faces are available, and gives a hint as to how customers navigated specimen books and what printers expected them to know. Monastic apparently remains popular. Near the end

                        <h3>Bishop's specimens of job work for printers</h3>
                        <p>Henry Gold Bishop</p>
                        <p>1890</p>
                        <p>Oneonta, NY</p>
                    </header>
                    <p>The typography of Bishop's book echo his sentiment that plain job work is good and appropriate. His attitude suggests that the decline of ostentatious types (which of course never fully disappeared) is significantly due to people getting tired of the endless loud typeface, whether novel or familiar&mdash;which sounds exactly like something I would say about a typeface that I see too frequently because it's the default font in a website template.  Yet the overall principles of design don't seem to have shifted too much yet.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>In these days of “Specimens of Printing,” when so many printers are I trying to outdo each other in producing examples of work of which for variety of design and brilliancy of color the world has never seen the
                            like, it may appear rash to issue a specimen book of plain, everyday jobs and expect people to buy it.</p>
                        <p>But as I am thoroughly convinced that this “variety of design and brilliancy of color” style has been overdone, and that there is a great need to come back to good plain work, I now venture to put this book on the market and expect a very large and rapid sale. Not because it is better or even as good as others, from an artistic point of view, but because it will be more useful and so be better appreciated by the great mass of those who are trying to make a living in
                            the
                            printing business.</p>
                        <p>I do not claim that every job shown in the following pages is as nicely set up as it might be, nor do I deny that many of them are much below the quality of work which is being turned out by some good printers; neither do I claim that they are shown quite to the best advantage, owing to the fact that they had to be reproduced by photo process, and from originals that were somewhat defective in the presswork. (10)</p>
                    </blockquote>


                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The selection of suitable faces of types is of first importance. There are some types which seem to be just made for certain classes of work, but would be entirely out of place if used on others. In selecting types the compositor must be guided by the nature of the business or profession of the customer. For lawyers, doctors, schools and institutions small plain faces are most suitable. For companies, corporations and State work larger plain faces will be more
                            appropriate.
                            For wholesale mercantile houses good, substantial, well formed faces, with just enough ornamentation to give them style, should be used, or some lines of script may be introduced to advantage. Retail tradesmen mostly prefer showy, ornamental faces with curves, panels and perhaps cuts which illustrate some portion of their business. Church and other religious work calls for old English texts and other ecclesiastical faces, of which there are many series.</p>
                        <p>But in every case it must be borne in mind that legibility is of more consequence than the most artistic arrangement or fanciful design. Where both can be obtained, of course, it is all right, but too often the former is sacrificed for the latter. There are plenty of good readable faces which have style and finish, and these should be chosen rather than those which have only flourishes to recommend them. An inferior workman will often try to cover up his deficiency by
                            using
                            the most fanciful types, but, alas, he only makes more manifest the poverty of his ideas. (11)</p>

                        <p>Wesley Washington Pasko</p>
                        <p>1894</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>Pasko is perhaps the most opinionated author on this page, but his observations are invaluable. Even if they aren't fully representative of popular sentiment, they tell us something about what was actually happening and how people might have felt about it.  Perhaps because this is an encyclopedia, he sometimes gets highly technical with his entries.</p> 
                    <blockquote><p>[Entry for "Display"] Each kind of job has its own requirements, to which the display should conform. In a poster the letter should be heavy, so as to be read from a distance; but in a letter circular it should all be light. Except in those cases where only one kind of letter is used of larger and smaller sizes there should be a considerable variety, and most job hands lay down as a rule that the same kind shall not be employed twice in the same job, except where it is a heading.</p>
                        <p>In setting the lines the principal line should first be chosen. It must be above the centre of the page, and preferably one-quarter or one-fifth from the top. It ought to be, other things being equal, the largest and longest. The next line is then selected, according to its importance. It is generally below the centre.. Then the next two or three important ones, and afterwards all which require much emphasis. Each one of these lines should be different in
                        style of type from the others, and should differ also in length. The unimportant display lines follow, and finally the text.</p> <p>....</p> 

                        <p>The following rules, drawn from many sources, are among those which should be observed:</p> 
               <p>Never crowd a long line of words marked for prominent display into one line of type, if to do so you have to use condensed or not easily read letter. Put the words in lines of the same size and style of type.</p> 
                         <p>Ornamental letter should be sparingly used in advertisements or in legal or mercantile work.</p> 
                         <p>The plainer faces of black-letter and pointed texts can be used in the display of law and church work, but they must be used moderately and with discretion.</p> 
                        <p>Never use script, card texts or any type with large shoulders and long ascending and descending letters on any work in which the space is contracted and which does not allow a liberal use of leads.</p> 
                         <p>Even in ornamental work use ornaments and ornamental letter sparingly. They are not ornamental when used in excess or inappropriately.</p> 
                      <p>As a rule, legibility is wanted oftener than ornament. Plain faces have more admirers than fancy letters.</p> 
                         <p>When a bold display is wanted in a crowded space use small, plain and heavy type for the text letter.</p> <p>....</p> 


                        
<p>As there can be no good display without relief, display lines should be so arranged that the relief of small text types will not be all at the tail of the work, nor all of the contrast of white space at the end of lines. Distribute display lines equally all over the entire work, so far as simple and orderly arrangement of the copy will admit.</p> <p>....</p><p>An example of most styles and varieties of job-work can be seen in Bishop's Specimens of Job-Work.</p></blockquote>


                    <blockquote><p>["Display Type"] It is said the ornamental faces and sizes now used in job-work amount to about nine thousand. The early printers had nothing in the way of display type except their scripts and peculiar black-letters. Nor did the number increase very rapidly until after 1820. Then the antiques, and still later the Clarendons, came in. At present, owing to the facility of reproduction afforded by the electrotype process, a new face can scarcely appear in any quarter of the
                        globe without
                        being repeated elsewhere.</p> <p>....</p>
                    <p>[T]here are those styles in which there is a studied irregularity, or in which there is a disposition to follow fancy rather than precedent. These have been multiplied beyond number; they run up into many thousands, and are likely to further increase.</p></blockquote>


                    <blockquote><p>The usual divisions are light-face, heavy-face, extended, expanded, extra extended or expanded, con- densed and extra condensed. There is no rule among type-founders for naming these styles, each doing as seems best to him, and it is, therefore, almost impossible to remember the terminology. Many are known only as Ornamented No. 52 or No. 117, or some other figure.</p></blockquote>





                    <blockquote><p>["Job Printing"] A job office requires system, even more so than a book office, for the work is small, and each order is as different from other orders as the skill of man can make it, and each avails itself of all of the varieties of type, border and rule which exist, but which the other branches of the trade are forbidden to use.</p> <p>....</p><p>There are several faces which are absolutely necessary in their complete series, such as Gothic, antique, Clarendon and light- face expanded. Others are nearly as important, while some are undesirable except in small or in large sizes, such as full face or bold face, as it is variously entitled. This shows best in small type. Grecian can only be obtained in large type, and very heavy antique is now only in use in posters and other outdoor work. For the
                        bodies of
                        posters, where formerly a very heavy Roman was used, a better style is now employed — an Ionic or a Clarendon light-face condensed. It is the custom of good job printers to buy nearly everything they can in series, and in light work all oi the display in one job is frequently in larger and smaller sizes of the same face. The largest size of metal type is now twelve-line pica, but wood type can be obtained as large as is desirable. Twenty-four or thirty line pica is
                        large
                        enough for the principal line in a single-sheet poster, sixty lines will do for a two or three sheet poster, and a hundred lines for any office which does not make a specialty of this kind of work. A variety of scripts is essential in a large office, but in a small office one or two kinds, with some of the new and fashionable Italics, are sufficient. Old style must be provided throughout, and if the office is small and cannot get both old style and plain Roman it had
                        better dispense with the latter.</p><p>....</p>
<p>All type should be selected by the manager or proprietor. The tone of work of an office is insensibly fixed by the supervision of its owner, so that work from his place will look unlike that from another office, which could not be the case if foreman after foreman selected the styles. 311</p></blockquote>
