            <h1>Typeface Dictionary</h1>
            <p>Typeface design is complex and always evolving. The definitions below are general guides for making sense of 19th century type styles, but they may not be 100% accurate to every typeface named with these terms. As much logic as there was in the naming of typefaces, there were also no hard and fast rules for using specific terms, not so different from today.</p>
            <h2>Properties</h2>
            <p>This is not a technical term, but I thought it was important to differentiate qualities that many different type styles (i.e. font families) can have from the styles themselves.</p>

                    The point sizes we know today were originally used by Chicago typefounders Marder, Luse, & Co.<sup>1</sup> after their foundry was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.<sup>2, 3</sup> Although type sizes were relatively similar from foundry to foundry, they were far from consistent, so adopting the point size system was helpful to printers and a good marketing move.<sup>3</sup> By
                    1886, the United States Typefounders Association moved to officially accept the new point size system.<sup>4</sup>
                    Prior to points, type sizes had names:<sup>5</sup>

                <dd>The protrusions at the corners of letters. There are two main types, bracketed (growing smoothly from the letter, think Times New Roman) and unbracketed (unsmoothed/squared off from the letter, think Rockwell).</dd>

            <dl>
                <dt>Blackletter, black, Gothic</dt>
                <dd>A style based on incunabula type. Pasko, writing in 1894, says that writers use "Gothic" to mean "blackletter", but printers use it to mean "sans serif" (which is also how I use it on this site).<sup>6</sup> Blackletter faces are also sometimes just called "black" in specimen books.</dd>
                <dt>Didone, Fatface, Modern</dt>
                <dd>Upright, Roman-like face with extreme contrast between thick and thin strokes and thin unbracketed serifs. They were previously called "Modern" and are also called "Didones" after two 18th-century originators of the style, rival typefounders Didot and Bodoni.<sup>7</sup></dd>
                <dt>Display</dt>
                <dd>A general term for faces that intended for job work. They may or may not be ornamented, and they are frequently large.</dd>
                <dt>Italian, French Clarendon</dt>
                <dd>"Reverse contrast" fatfaces.<sup>8</sup> Instead of having heavy stems, they are heavy on the top and bottom. One of the best known examples is Playbill.</dd>
                <dt>Ornamented, Ornamental</dt>
                <dd>Fancy, ostentatious, or weird types that don't really fall under other categories, and are generally intended for job work.</dd>
                <dt>Roman</dt>
                <dd>Sometimes used as a catchall term for the most common upright Latin letterforms, but also what we think of as the typical Latin typeface. It has bracketed serifs and little to no variation in the stroke width, unlike the similarly shaped Didones.</dd>
                <dt>Sans serif, Gothic</dt>
                <dd>Any style of type that does not have serifs of any kind. Though the term "sans serif" existed in the 1800s, Pasko dubs it a British term for "Gothic".<sup>9</sup></dd>
                <dt>Script</dt>
                <dd>Based on handwriting, whether calligraphic or otherwise.<sup>10</sup> The letters may or may not be connected.</dd>
                <dt>Slab serif, antique, Clarendon</dt>
                <dd>
                    Faces with thick serifs that are typically square and have little to no bracketing. They often have fairly consistent stroke width, but may have some variation along the stroke (e.g. where two strokes meet). "Slab serif" appears to be a more modern term, but the others were all in use during the 19th century. In general, antiques are more slab-like and square, whereas Clarendons have more stroke variation and bracketing. Other styles, such as Doric, Ionic, Celtic, Runic, and
                    Grecian, can be considered sub-categories of slab serifs.<sup>11</sup>

                </dd>

                <dt>Tuscan</dt>
                <dd>Display faces, often ornamented, and generally with "bi- or trifurcated (branched) serifs or mannered stroke terminations (pointed, rounded, concaved, chiseled, wedged…); an active, energetic contour; and medial decoration. Tuscans can also be additively ornamented (shades, shadows, fills, patterned interiors…)".<sup>12</sup> In other words, almost any "Wild West"-esque face that is not an Italian.</dd>
